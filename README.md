# About my Project
In this project I have used MongoDB for NOSQL database,Jupyter,MongoDB Compass, PyMongo,Built-in Packages like JSON.
As we are using MongoDB we can query and know about category of meal and the type of cuisine and meal has a unique id. To query some of the commands which I have used are Insert_one,Insert_many,delete_one,delete_many,update one, update_many, limit, find, drop,sort. To start with this first we will have to establish a connection between Jupyter and MangoDB and here PyMongo comes in handy, it establishes a connection between MongoDb database.
